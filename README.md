# Yomi-kaeru: A Language Learning App

Yomi-kaeru is an app and browser extension that can scan through text on a webpage and periodically translate words into Japanese. The idea is to give the user passive exposure to the language they're trying to learn by peppering translated words throughout their everyday internet use.
