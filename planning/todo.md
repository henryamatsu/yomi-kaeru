# MVP Development
- √ find charactersets to insert into db (maybe create for 2-3 first tiers)
- √ create html display where you can insert text and have it turned into html with translations
- √ find words throughout text and translate + highlight + insert into span (hover window can come later)
- √ ignore your notes, and include hover window anyways
- √ use AI to generate some sample text that uses a lot of the characters
- √ make it so users can select their characterset preferences (frequency and learning progress can come later)
